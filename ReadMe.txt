1) Adding to the list:
	1. You are able to add tasks via filling the forms and pessing the button "Add".
	2. Longtitude and Latitude can be only obtained by clicking or dragging the marker on the map. 
	3. You need to fill all the froms in order to add the task. Name should be no longer than 10 letters.

2) Displaying/Editing tasks:
	1. The list of the tasks will be displayed on the right-hand side.
	2. Edit process: click the "Edit" button, now the Main form becomes the Edit form, input your changes the same way as 
	you add tasks and press "Save" button. The task now is edited. Note: While in edit mode, you cannot press other buttons but "Save".

3) Removing tasks:
	1. Press "Delete" button and the task will be removed.

4) Displaying the list:
	1. The list with details is diplayed on the right-hand side.

5) Object-orientedness:
	1. I understand that it is easier to create this list without having those tasks as objects, but anyway I decided to store
	all of the tasks as objects in the array, because I think it might come handy in case you will need to get
	the access to the data.
